# Activity 2 - Code First

## Overview
This project is developed using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), integrating Entity Framework for a database-first approach. It demonstrates the utilization of Entity Framework within a WPF application to interact with a database, showcasing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a sample database.

## Features
- **Entity Framework Database-First Approach:** Leverages Entity Framework to generate model classes based on an existing database schema.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations against the database through a user-friendly WPF interface.
- **Data Binding:** Utilizes data binding features in WPF to synchronize UI components with data sources for an interactive user experience.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to separate the UI from business logic, facilitating easier maintenance and testing.
